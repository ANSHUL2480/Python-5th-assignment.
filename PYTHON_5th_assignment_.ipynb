        "Ans:- 🔹 Challenges Associated with Memory Management in Python Although Python automates memory management using its garbage collection and reference counting systems, there are still several challenges developers might face.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ 1. Memory Leaks\n",
        "\n",
        "Caused when objects are unintentionally kept alive due to lingering references.\n",
        "\n",
        "Often occurs with circular references or global/static variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ 2. Inefficient Memory Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's high-level abstractions (lists, dictionaries, objects) may use more memory than low-level languages like C.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data structures can become memory-heavy if not optimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ 3. Circular References\n",
        "\n",
        "Reference counting alone can’t handle them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's garbage collector detects and collects these, but it's not always perfect or fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ 4. Unreleased Resources\n",
        "\n",
        "Objects like file handles, DB connections, or sockets consume memory if not explicitly closed.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ 5. Global Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Keeping large objects in the global scope may delay garbage collection or increase memory footprint unnecessarily.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ 6. Misuse of C Extensions or Third-party Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "Some C-based libraries may not integrate well with Python’s garbage collector, leading to leaks.\n",

        "Creating large objects repeatedly without clearing them or letting them expire can cause memory bloat over time\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- 🔹 How to Raise an Exception Manually in Python In Python, you can manually raise an exception using the raise statement. This is helpful when you want to flag custom errors or enforce rules in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Multithreading allows a program to run multiple tasks concurrently within the same process — which can significantly improve performance and responsiveness in the right scenarios.\n",

        "\n",
        "Improved Responsiveness\n",

        "In GUI applications, threads prevent the interface from freezing during long-running tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Better Resource Utilization\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads can share memory and data easily within the same process, making communication between tasks more efficient than multiprocessing.\n",

        "Efficient I/O-bound Task Handling\n",
        "\n",
